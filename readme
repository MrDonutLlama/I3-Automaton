I3-Automaton Readme

I3 Automaton is a framework designed to make installing, creating, and sharing "Themes", Workflows, or customizations to I3WM and a few different suites of applications that work around it as well.
This framework is being designed to be extensible, modular, and flexible to allow "Theme" creators to have a high level of customizability with the way they handle their setups.

Currently Deeply WIP



[Installation Instructions]
Run bootstrapper.sh - This will check for Python3, Pip3, and Ansible at the latest package manager version (to when this was last updated), if they are not already installed it will install them.

Run

ansible-playbook setup.yaml

next, This ansible playbook sets up the folder structure for the configuration files, as well as for the wallpaper management. It then copies the most current version of all configuration files as well as the logo file into their respective folders.

feh:
Feh needs a folder at /home/*USER*/Pictures/wallpaper, shove all of the pictures you want on your desktop in here, every startup it will pick a random picture and throw it up on your monitor, effortlessley works for multi monitor albeit you will need to use xrandr to determine the names of your monitors currently and apply them as the variables for $firstmonitor $secondmonitor and $thirdmonitor (Add more if you feel like it, i only have three so that's where i stopped)
